<h1>DMCA Policy</h1>
<p>This Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy (“Policy”) applies to the https://seekivo.online/ website (“Website” or “Service”) and any of its related products and services (collectively, “Services”) and outlines how this Website operator (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”) addresses copyright infringement notifications and how you (“you” or “your”) may submit a copyright infringement complaint.</p><br>
<p>Protection of intellectual property is of utmost importance to us and we ask our users and their authorized agents to do the same. It is our policy to expeditiously respond to clear notifications of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) of 1998, the text of which can be found on the U.S. Copyright Office <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a>.</p><br>

<h2><strong>What to consider before submitting a copyright complaint</strong></h2>
<p>Please note that if you are unsure whether the material you are reporting is in fact infringing, you may wish to contact an attorney before filing a notification with us.</p><br>
<p>The DMCA requires you to provide your personal information in the copyright infringement notification. If you are concerned about the privacy of your personal information, you may wish to <a href="https://www.copyrighted.com/professional-takedowns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">use an agent</a> to report infringing material for you.</p><br>

All such Notifications must comply with the DMCA requirements.</p><br>
<p>Filing a DMCA complaint is the start of a pre-defined legal process. Your complaint will be reviewed for accuracy, validity, and completeness. If your complaint has satisfied these requirements, our response may include the removal or restriction of access to the allegedly infringing material.</p><br>
<p>If we remove or restrict access to materials or terminate any account in response to a notification of alleged infringement, we will make a good faith effort to contact the affected user with information concerning the removal or restriction of access.</p><br>
<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any portion of this Policy, the Operator reserves the right to take no action upon receipt of a DMCA copyright infringement notification if it fails to comply with all the requirements of the DMCA for such notifications.</p><br>

<h2><strong>Changes & amendments</strong></h2>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms related to the Website and Services at any time at our discretion. When we do, we will post a notification on the main page of the Website.

<p>An updated version of this Policy will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised policy unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Website and Services after the effective date of the revised Policy (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute your consent to those changes.</p><br>
